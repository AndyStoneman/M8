Goals: 

- Make a song that creates a nice calming, thought-provoking ambiance to go with some still shots.
- Make it have a recurring theme that builds, a short bridge period, and then return to the main 
theme. 

Layers:

- Vinyl Cracking:
	A sample of white noise combined with subtle vinyl crackling. Use it to fill the space and 
	give the song some color. 

- Primary Synth:
	A big sounding pad synth that is the driving force in setting the ambiance. Gives a kind of 
	ephereal energy that sets the tone. 

- Piano: 
	Introduce a simple arpeggio melody using a piano that is introduced later on and is layered
	over the Primary Synth. This will sound light a pretty, playing primarily higher notes. 

- Bass:
	After a round of the Primary Synth, introduce a Bass to fill the low frequencies and make the
	song sound fuller, particularly as it will be lacking in the lower frequencies. 

- Guitar Sample:
	Pitch a guitar sample into the proper key, and make it a big slow sounding sample, using 
	reverb and a slowed rate to draw it out. This part will be in the bridge, combined with the 
	bass. 

- Percussion: 
	The last layer will be some percussion samples just playing on the quarter beats. These will 
	only come in at the culmination of the song when all instruments are playing together, adding
	a rhythmic effect. 


STRUCTURE:

- Introduction:
	The introduction will start with just the vinyl crackling, and then move to the start of 
	the Primary Synth, creating a nice beginning. 

- Building:
	The building section will consist of slowly adding layers over the Primary Synth, including 
	the Piano and the Bass.

- Bridge:
	This will consist of the Bass and the Guitar Sample, serving as a break from the primary 
	melody and progression. 

- Culmination:
	This will be everything all together, plus some added percussion!


OTHER NOTES:

- Want to make most things sound really big and distant to create calming, thought-provoking 
ambiance. 

- Need to come up with compelling chord progression, likely using seventh chords to add to this 
effect, as well as make the song interesting. 

- Need to make the song work with the still video shots that I will be taking, so keep that in mind 
throughout production process.
