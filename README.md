## Title: MindSetting
### Creator: Andy Stoneman

## Description
This goal of this piece is to create a thought-provoking ambiance that allows for deep reflection and inner-thought. However, it does not attempt to take you any particular direction, just to let the listener sit with however they may currently be feeling. 

In the context of the video, it is an attempt to feel at ease with the aspects of Bowdoin's campus. Most students experience the campus amidst a whirlwind of academic, social, and life stresses circulating our minds. In effect, it becomes difficult to perceive the campus as just a beautiful landscape with magnificent architecture and a home to an incredible community. These long shots in accompaniment with the music I've made, intend to allow the viewer to relax and visualize Bowdoin setting outside of their stressed mindsets, hence the title "MindSetting".
