## Title: MindSetting
### Creator: Andy Stoneman

## Description
This goal of this piece is to create a thought-provoking ambiance that allows for deep reflection and inner-thought. However, it does not attempt to take you any particular direction, just to let the listener sit with however they may currently be feeling. 

In the context of the video, it is an attempt to feel at ease with the aspects of Bowdoin's campus. Most students, and I imagine professors at times as well, experience the campus amidst a whirlwind of academic, social, and life stresses circulating our minds. In effect, it becomes difficult to perceive the campus as just a beautiful landscape with magnificent architecture, home to so many curious, intriguing minds. These long shots in accompaniment with the music I've made intend to allow the viewer to relax, visualize, and contemplate the Bowdoin setting outside of their stressed mindsets, hence the title "MindSetting". I hope you enjoy, and perhaps see Bowdoin's campus through a new lens after watching, and of course, good luck with your exams!
